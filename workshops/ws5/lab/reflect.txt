Workshop 5
In this workshop, we learned about implementing helper functions and overloading operators for a class. I really enjoyed this workshop as it showed some of the key functionalities of class based and object oriented programming.  Being able to overload operators makes it a lot easier to interact with objects in the program and other helper functions help to maintain class privacy while still being able to access private members.  I would assume that a lot of these help functions and operators would be pretty standard for most classes, so I'm looking forward to seeing how c++ and programmers have dealt with the all the potential boilerplate that comes with creating certain classes. Overall, I am excited to continue to learn about object oriented programming and c++.  Looking forward to the next workshop!

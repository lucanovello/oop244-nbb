In this workshop, we learned how to manage dynamic memory allocation and handle different constructors to create flexible object instantiations. I didn't have too many problems overall but i did encounter an issue with the "Canister& Canister::pour(Canister& C)" function. I was getting the wrong volume back but after playing around with some breakpoints, I realized that the problem was the order that the checks were being called.  I was checking the same content and assigning unusable before performing the pour.  Other than that, I found the workshop pretty straight forward and am looking forward to the upcoming workshops.

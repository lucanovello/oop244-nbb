In this workshop, we made a program that processed and printed a receipt to the console.  I really enjoyed this workshop as we got a chance to program a bunch of functions.  I have been struggling a little with pointers and when to use them so it was nice to focus on more of the logic.  In this workshop, we created 2 classes (Item & Bill) and added member attributes and functions.  The functions focused on creating, initializing, manipulating, outputting and destroying different Item objects.  Coming from a garbage collector background, I am enjoying the manual memory allocation and control that c++ offers, but it has also given me an appreciation for garbage collector languages.  Overall, I am enjoying the workshops and pace of the class so far, I am hoping to do more coding as I find that actually coding is the best way for me to learn.

Workshop 7 - Reflection
In this workshop, we focused on derived classes and custom input/output operators by implementing a `MotorVehicle` module and deriving a `Truck` class from it. This workshop highlighted key OOP concepts, such as inheritance, member function shadowing, and operator overloading. Designing the `MotorVehicle` class helped encapsulate common vehicle attributes like the license plate, address, and year of manufacturer. Custom constructors and functions like `moveTo`, `write`, and `read` ensured efficient data management while maintaining encapsulation. Overloading insertion and extraction operators improved the code's readability and usability.  Extending the `MotorVehicle` class to create the `Truck` class highlighted the benefites of inheritance and introduced attributes specific to trucks, such as cargo capacity and current load. Overall, I really enjoyed this workshop. It helped introduce inheritance while helping to reinforcing key principles we've already learned.

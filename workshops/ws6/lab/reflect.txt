Workshop 6 - Reflection
In this workshop, we learned about implementing the `TextFile` module, focusing on dynamic memory management, file operations, and operator overloading. I enjoyed this workshop as it demonstrated key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation and resource management. By creating helper functions like `setFilename`, `setNoOfLines`, and `loadText`, we ensured that our `TextFile` class efficiently managed file data while maintaining class privacy. Overloading operators, such as `operator=`, allowed for intuitive interactions with our objects, enhancing code readability and maintainability. The workshop also highlighted the importance of resource management through the implementation of constructors and destructor. I look forward to learning more topics in object-oriented programming and seeing how these principles are applied in real-world scenarios. Overall, this workshop was really fun and looking forward to the next workshop.
